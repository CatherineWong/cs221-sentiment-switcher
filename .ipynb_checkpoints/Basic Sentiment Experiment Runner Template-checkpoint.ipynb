      "2500_8.txt this movie was a sicky sweet cutesy romantic comedy, just the kind of movie i usually dislike but this one was just cute enough to keep me interested. it was really funny in one moment (probably why i liked it) and then just as serious in the next. plus, it had ellen in it and i've always had a soft spot for her.<br /><br />basically, the owner of a book store, helen (kate capshaw) finds a love letter in one of the old couches in her store. she thinks it is for her and goes crazy trying to figure out who sent it. she has kind of shut herself off from the world, so it really throws her for a loop. eventually, almost everyone connected with her finds this letter and they are all getting mixed signals which creates some really funny moments.<br /><br />like i said, i am usually not one for this type of movie but i really wound up enjoying it and recommend it highly. 8\n"
